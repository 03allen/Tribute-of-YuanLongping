      <p><b>Here's a time line of Yuan's life:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yuan was born in Beijing, China on September 7, 1930.</li>
        <li>He graduated from Southwest Agricultural College in 1953</li>
        <li>During the Great Leap Forward (1958–60) and the resulting famine, Yuan lived in the Hunan countryside. Nationwide, tens of millions died; some ate tree bark and grass. Yuan saw the bodies of those who had starved to death in the road. </li>
        <li>From 1960, Yuan focused on rice, China’s most important staple crop, working in the fields around his school. </li>
        <li>In the summer of 1961, Yuan discovered a stalk of hybrid rice in the wild.</li>
        <li>In 1964, he and a student spent the summer scouring miles of fields for naturally occurring male-sterile plants.</li>
        <li> Two years later he reported in a scientific publication that he had found a few individuals of male-sterile rice with potential for production of hybrid rice.</li>
        <li>Yuan went on to solve more problems over the next decades to achieve higher yielding hybrid rice.</li>
        <li>At present, as much as 50 percent of China's total number of rice paddies grow Yuan Longping's hybrid rice and these hybrid rice paddies yield 60 percent of the total rice production in China.</li>
        <li>At 13:07 on May 22, Yuan Longping died of multiple organ failure</li>
      </ul>
